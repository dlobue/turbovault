//! The harness's own self-test layer (turbovault-nbl.19) — the probes that keep
//! the **suite** honest, as distinct from the matrix cells that keep **`TurboVault`**
//! honest.
//!
//! `TurboVault`'s promise is to **ABORT** if the content on disk doesn't match what
//! you said the file looks like. WSS ensures this promise by setting up all
//! possible scenario combinations and making sure `TurboVault` aborts when it
//! *should* abort. Which means WSS is only as trustworthy as two things the
//! harness itself must get right — and each gets a probe here, one per axis the
//! matrix parameterizes over:
//!
//! 1. **Setup fidelity** ([`ProbeWorld`]) — the scenario a cell *claims* to set up
//!    is the scenario actually on disk, and the precondition it hands the op is the
//!    one the cell named. If `build_state(etcsu)` silently produced `etc-u`, every
//!    cell in that column would be exercising the wrong scenario and still "pass".
//!    [`ProbeWorld`] re-derives the state from git **independently** of
//!    `build_state` (via [`observe_git_state`]) and echoes back the resolved
//!    precondition.
//! 2. **Plumbing fidelity** ([`Probe`]) — every World actually reaches the write
//!    surface it names, and they all agree. The matrix asserts each world
//!    *separately* against a coarse expected [`Outcome`], so two worlds can diverge
//!    in ways no cell catches — a `classify_wire` mis-mapping, or a batch invoker
//!    swallowing an error kind. [`Probe`] is the minimal deterministic op, run on
//!    **all four** worlds over settled cells, asserting the observations are
//!    IDENTICAL.
//!
//! Scope: these probes check **clobber-safety plumbing, not content-correctness** —
//! WSS never asserts that written text is *formatted* right, only that a write
//! refuses-or-proceeds without silently losing an out-of-band change.
//!
//! They run in the default-harness `write_safety_suite` target (they test the
//! harness); the matrix cells run in `wss_matrix` (it tests `TurboVault`).
//!
//! SEAM (turbovault-nbl.13): [`ProbeWorld`] + the setup sweep are portable — they
//! need only `Vault`/`Layer`. [`Probe`]'s four invokers name the concrete worlds, so
//! they are the conformance checklist a new World (or a third-party backend) must
//! pass.
