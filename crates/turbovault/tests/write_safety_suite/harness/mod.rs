//! Shared harness primitives for the WSS write-safety matrix (turbovault-nbl.1).
//!
//! Primitives here are backend-independent and know nothing about any operation
//! under test. Each mutating op is a thin adapter that composes these. See the
//! design doc §7.

// Shared by two test binaries: the default-harness `write_safety_suite`
// (self-tests) and the `harness = false` `wss_matrix` (cells). Each exercises a
// different slice of the harness, and `wss_matrix` compiles the self-test `mod
// tests` without running them — so per-target "unused" is expected here.
