//! Per-operation adapters + the shared matrix-cell / trial machinery
//! (design doc §7).
//!
//! An op's shared data — its `Case` table + `ok_effect` — lives in its module,
//! layer-agnostic. The **invoker** is `impl SinglePathOp<W>`, one per
//! `(op, layer)`: it binds those cases to a layer-specific invocation. An op that
//! doesn't map to a layer simply has no invoker for that layer's World (e.g. the
//! compute ops have no `SinglePathOp<ManagerWorld>` impl — qae.9.2).
//!
//! Dual-path (`move_note`) and multi-op (`batch_execute`) adapters build their
//! own trials with [`cell_trial`]. Each matrix cell is a `libtest-mimic` trial →
//! its own named `cargo test` entry, prefixed `<layer>::<backend>::…`. `pending`
//! cells become **ignored** trials (the burndown).
