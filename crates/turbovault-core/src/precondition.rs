//! The op-level write precondition (turbovault-nbl.6 / GWS design §3).
//!
//! A single first-class precondition carried by every mutating op, borrowed from
//! HTTP conditional requests (If-Match / If-None-Match / ETag). It replaces the
//! `(force: Option<bool>, expected_hash: Option<String>)` pair the mutating ops
//! used to take.
//!
//! The version token is a git blob-oid **hex string** — keeping this type
//! git2-independent so it can live in `core`; the tool layer parses it to an oid
//! at the substrate boundary.
//!
//! **Cutover scope (nbl.6):** this is the signature carrier only. It is threaded
//! to the substrate's *existing* per-path primitives — which check against the
//! base/HEAD tree — so behavior is unchanged. Evaluating it against the WORKING
//! TREE (and the standalone dirty gate) is the later burndown (nbl.8).

/// | Variant | HTTP analogue | Meaning |

/// | [`ExpectExists`](Self::ExpectExists) | `If-Match: *` | path must exist, any content (in-place ops' default) |
