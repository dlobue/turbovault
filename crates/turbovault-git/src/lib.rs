//! # turbovault-git — git-native write substrate
//!
//! Every vault mutation is a git commit built from plumbing — blobs written to
//! the object DB, a tree assembled in an **isolated/ephemeral index** (never the
//! shared `.git/index`), a `commit-tree`, and a **compare-and-swap ref advance**
//! — then materialized into the working tree. Git history is the rollback/audit
//! log; `update-ref` CAS is the cross-process serialization primitive.
//!
//! Design: `git-write-substrate-architecture.md`. This crate replaces the
//! direct `VaultManager` write path (mutators, batch executor, path-lock
//! registry, audit/snapshot rollback).
//!
//! Layers (built bottom-up):
//! - [`VaultRepo`] — repo handle + detection + branch/HEAD resolution (GWS.1).
//! - [`TreeChange`] + `build_tree`/`commit_tree` — object-DB plumbing (GWS.2).
//! - `cas_ref`/`commit_with_retry` — ref compare-and-swap + optimistic
//!   rebuild-on-conflict (GWS.3).
//! - (next) per-file precondition, materialization, changesets (GWS.4+).
