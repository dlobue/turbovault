"""WSS write-safety matrix reporter (turbovault-qae.9 / nbl.20).

Runs the `wss_matrix` libtest-mimic binary with the pending flag bypassed
(`--include-ignored`) — the source of truth for what actually passes/fails —
plus an `--ignored`-only pass to learn which cells are currently marked
`pending`. Renders ONE all-in-one table shaped like
`docs/write-safety-suite/wss-precondition-matrix.csv` (same state column
headers, with `world` and `backend` added as leading columns), then the burndown
summary and the two lists that drive the pending/active reconciliation:

  * un-pend candidates : cells marked `pending` that now PASS  -> should activate
  * newly-failing      : active cells that FAIL                -> should pend

Output is **Markdown with emoji status**, so a terminal run can be pasted
straight into a GitHub comment or PR body with no ANSI colour to strip and no
legend to remember — every symbol is defined in the legend it prints.

Stdlib only, zero external deps. `--html <path>` writes the same table as one
self-contained HTML file.

Column/row orders and the N/A rule mirror the Rust source of truth
(`harness/state.rs` GitState::ALL + its `(e,t,c,s,u)` codes,
`harness/precondition.rs` PreconditionKind, `Backend::supports_state`); keep
them in sync if those change.
