## Individual Crate Documentation

### [turbovault-core](../crates/turbovault-core/README.md)

**Core data models, error types, and configuration for the Obsidian vault management system.**

This crate provides the foundational types and utilities that all other `TurboVault` crates depend on. It defines the canonical data structures, error handling, configuration management, and cross-cutting concerns like metrics and validation.

**Key Components:**
- **Data Models**: `VaultFile`, `Link`, `Tag`, `TaskItem`, `Callout`, `Heading`, `Frontmatter`
- **Error Types**: Unified error system with composable error handling
- **Configuration**: `ServerConfig`, `VaultConfig` with validation
- **Multi-Vault Management**: Coordination between multiple vaults
- **Metrics**: Lightweight metrics collection with zero locking overhead
- **Validation**: Content validation framework with extensible validators
- **Profiles**: Pre-tuned configurations for different deployment scenarios
- **Resilience**: Retry logic, circuit breakers, and error recovery patterns

### [turbovault-parser](../crates/turbovault-parser/README.md)

**Obsidian Flavored Markdown (OFM) parser for extracting structured data from Obsidian vault files.**

This crate provides fast, production-ready parsing of Obsidian markdown files, extracting structured data from various markdown elements.

**Key Components:**
- **Frontmatter Parser**: YAML metadata extraction from `---` delimited blocks

### [turbovault-graph](../crates/turbovault-graph/README.md)

**Link graph analysis and vault health diagnostics for Obsidian vaults.**

This crate provides comprehensive analysis of the link graph within Obsidian vaults, enabling discovery of relationships, identification of important notes, detection of broken links, and overall vault health assessment.

**Key Components:**
- **Graph Building**: Creates link graph from parsed vault files
- **Backlinks**: Find all files that link TO a specific file
- **Forward Links**: Find all files that a specific file links TO
- **Related Notes**: Co-citation and similarity analysis
- **Cycle Detection**: Find circular references in the link graph
- **Orphan Detection**: Find files with no incoming or outgoing links
- **Connected Components**: Find isolated clusters of notes
- **Health Analysis**: Overall vault health scoring and recommendations
- **Hub Detection**: Identify highly-connected notes
- **Broken Link Detection**: Find links that don't resolve to existing files

**Architecture:**
- Immutable graph built once and never modified
- Uses `petgraph` for efficient graph operations
- Thread-safe read-only operations
- Memory efficient with O(1) lookups via hash maps

### [turbovault-vault](../crates/turbovault-vault/README.md)

**Filesystem API for Obsidian vaults** – file operations, atomic transactions, real-time watching, and caching.

This crate provides the core abstraction for interacting with the Obsidian vault filesystem. It handles all file I/O with atomic operation guarantees, maintains consistency with the parser and graph layers, and provides real-time file watching for synchronization.

**Key Components:**
- **VaultManager**: Primary interface for vault operations
- **AtomicFileOps**: ACID-like transaction support for file operations
- **VaultWatcher**: Real-time filesystem monitoring using `notify` crate
- **File Cache**: TTL-based caching with invalidation on writes
- **Path Security**: Prevents traversal attacks and validates paths
- **Integration**: Coordinates with parser and graph layers

**Architecture:**
- Single source of truth for all file operations
- Thread-safe with `Arc<RwLock<>>` for concurrent access
- Real-time sync through file watcher integration
- Defensive programming with comprehensive error handling

### [turbovault-batch](../crates/turbovault-batch/README.md)

**Validated, sequential batches of file operations for Obsidian vaults.**

This crate validates operations for overlapping paths, executes them in order,
and stops at the first failure. Individual file writes are atomic, but the
batch is not transactional: earlier successful operations are not rolled back.

**Key Components:**
- **BatchExecutor**: Validates and sequences operations
- **CreateNote**: Create a note
- **WriteNote**: Write or replace a note
- **DeleteNote**: Remove a note
- **MoveNote**: Move a note without rewriting incoming links
- **UpdateLinks**: Replace a link target in one explicitly named note
- **Conflict Detection**: Pre-validate operations before execution
- **Detailed Results**: Report successful changes and the first failure

**Architecture:**
- Pre-validation to detect conflicts before execution
- Sequential fail-fast execution
- Atomic replacement for individual file writes
- No batch-wide rollback or cross-process locking

### [turbovault-export](../crates/turbovault-export/README.md)

**Data export functionality for vault analysis in multiple formats.**

This crate provides comprehensive export capabilities for Obsidian vault data, enabling downstream analysis, reporting, and integration with external tools. It supports multiple output formats and export types for different use cases.

**Key Components:**
- **ExportEngine**: Main export interface
- **Format Handlers**: JSON, CSV, Markdown, XML exporters
- **Health Report**: Comprehensive vault health analysis
- **Broken Links Report**: Detailed analysis of broken links
- **Vault Statistics**: Comprehensive vault metrics and analytics
- **Analysis Report**: Detailed vault analysis with insights
- **Streaming Export**: Memory-efficient processing for large vaults

**Architecture:**
- Format-agnostic design supporting multiple output formats
- Data-rich exports with comprehensive vault information
- Performance optimized with efficient streaming
- Extensible design for adding new formats and export types

### [turbovault-tools](../crates/turbovault-tools/README.md)

**MCP Tools Layer** - The bridge between AI agents and Obsidian vault operations.

This crate implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that enable AI agents to discover, query, analyze, and manage Obsidian vaults through a structured, type-safe API. It orchestrates all vault operations by integrating the parser, graph, vault, batch, and export crates into a cohesive agent-friendly interface.

**Key Components:**
- **70 MCP Tools**: Vault management API exposed through focused providers
- **Search Engine**: Tantivy-powered full-text search with TF-IDF ranking
- **Template Engine**: Pre-built templates with field validation
- **11 Tool Categories**: FileTools, SearchTools, SearchEngine, TemplateEngine, AnalysisTools, GraphTools, BatchTools, ExportTools, ValidationTools, MetadataTools, RelationshipTools, VaultLifecycleTools
- **Agent-Optimized API**: Discoverable tools with clear names and parameters
- **Production-Grade**: OpenTelemetry observability, error handling, performance monitoring

**Architecture:**
- Agent-optimized API surface with discoverable tools
- Production-grade search engine built on Tantivy
- Template system for consistent note creation
- Comprehensive vault analysis and health monitoring

### [turbovault-plugin-api](../../crates/turbovault-plugin-api/README.md)

**Stable host boundary for compiled-in, feature-gated plugins.**

This crate defines the curated `VaultApi`, plugin factory/provider contracts,
strict namespacing rules, and bounded best-effort hook delivery. It
intentionally does not expose raw vault managers or server internals. See the
[plugin architecture guide](../development/plugins.md).

### [turbovault-server](../crates/turbovault-server/README.md)

**Production-Grade MCP Server for Obsidian Vault Management**

The main executable binary exposes 70 MCP tools for AI agents to manage Obsidian vaults. This is the entry point for end users; it composes focused providers over the core, parser, graph, vault, batch, export, and tools crates into a unified Model Context Protocol server.

**Key Components:**
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line argument parsing and configuration
- **MCP Server**: STDIO transport for MCP protocol communication
- **70 MCP Tools**: Stable flat API backed by focused providers
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration for production monitoring
- **Configuration Profiles**: Pre-tuned configurations for different use cases
- **Vault Management**: Multi-vault support with runtime configuration

**Architecture:**
- Main binary that orchestrates all other crates
